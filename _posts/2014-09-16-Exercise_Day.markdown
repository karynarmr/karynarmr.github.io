I struggled with nesting divs.  Considering my knowledge up to this point had only the brief description “ad container”, I think I did ok.  The padding and margins were all wrong. But whatever, what the hell are those anyway.  

Not to mention colors.  But whatever, focus on the layout they said.  Fine.

The other thing I super struggled with was when I finished the first exercise and went to start the second. To start, I copied the first in order to create the second.  I was just going to make some minor updates to the second rather than reinventing the wheel!  Brilliant!  I am already head of the game!

Or so I thought.


It took me over an hour to figure out I was still referencing the stylesheet from the first exercise in the second HTML index file.  Can't really change the height and width of anything and see it push out if I'm referencing the wrong stylesheet.  Brilliant, indeed.
