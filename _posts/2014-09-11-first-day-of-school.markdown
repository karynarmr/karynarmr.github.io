In preparation for my first day of class, my mother came to visit me the weekend prior.   As I finished up some of the last pre-work exercises, she thought for sure I could use some good ol’ comfort food.  She made meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans.  My favorite. 

She told me it was the least she could do.  She had thought about bringing over a care-package with scantrons, #2 pencils, and extra erasers.  Mom, it’s not that kind of school.  

We both had a good laugh, and I had a second helping

So around rolls the first day of school... nervous jitters to say the least.  I had been reminded to sit in the front row, and not get distracted by others in the class.  My anxiety had also been soothed by phrases like “no, u don’t need to make friends or talk to anyone”.  “That’s not why you’re there”.   Beep boop. 

First day was called Install Day.  Install all the things.  Download all the things.  My self-proclaimed nick name for the class is "Windows".  I’m not compatible.  I-What?

The instructors kept buzzing around me, chanting things like “Git-Bash”, “Windows-this”, and “Windows-that”.  

And NO.  I DID have to talk to someone.  It was awkward.  I am awkward.   I had to stand up in front of the whole class and tell them everything about myself.  And the age-old argument came up in my head:  “To tell them about Derby, or to not tell them about Derby”

I panicked as I struggled to find something else “interesting about myself (other than Derby) so I spilled it.  UGH, now I’m that girl.  …“That Windows girl who can kick my ass”

Hopefully day two will be smoother.
