Before I begin, I think it’s important to understand, and remember, why I started this journey into Code-Land.  

I have been working with online ads for going on about 10 years now.  Sure, I’ve picked up a couple useful tricks along the way… I can tell you about z-index and i-frames (the two most troublesome settings when working with ads).  I know that “div” is code-speak for ad container.  But that is about as far as my knowledge went. 

I progressed in my career from client services to Team Lead.  Managing people.  Which is where the fun really began.  I went through hiring, firing, performance improvement plans, verbal warnings, written warnings, and countless meetings with HR, all within the span of about 8 months.  One of the hardest learning curves I had ever endured was working with a troublesome employee.  And as you get to know me, you will learn that one of the things I absolutely hate the most is a fucking learning curve.  I digress… 

Whatever, managing people is hard.  And as it turns out, I hate it.  So my coding journey began as I struggled to learn how to manage people.  Troubleshooting ads should be way less messy.  And certainly less tears involved.  And less meetings with HR for sure.  I only saw positives.  

An Android Developer friend of mine, and Feminist, convinced me that coding was an invaluable skill/trade, as a woman, I should learn immediately.   Damn Robot. 

At this point in my career, sitting in a dark room not talking to anyone, getting lost in Code-Land sounded like exactly the sort of thing I so desperately needed.  

So off to fine the path to Code-Land I went. 

I went to a million meet-ups.  Some free, some paid for.  Some with free drinks, others with missing water fountains.  

I did a million online-tutorials.  All free.  All with my water bottle close by.  

I became enthralled with the slightest bit of knowledge I gained.  One tutorial in particular had me changing the background color of a button from green to pink.  I swear I worked on that for 3 hours before I called Robot.  I had forgotten the “;”.  Damn Robot. 

Shortly thereafter, Robot told me about MakerSquare.  Beep boop.  And it was then that the path to Code-Land appeared.  Off I went…
